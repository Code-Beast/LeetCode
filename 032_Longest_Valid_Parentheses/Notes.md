# NOTES

1. In javascript, ```for in``` gives keys (indices), instead, ```for of``` gives items.

2. list in python3 and array in javascript both have method ```pop()``` for pop out the last item in the sequence, while in java ArrayList it is ```l.remove(l.size() - 1)```

3. You can use negetive index in slice() method of array in javascript but not in square index [].

4. In java ArrayList, you need to use get() to fetch item, instead of []

5. In python3 list, addition is append(); in javascript array, push(); in java ArrayList, add()
